# saga.asisaga.com

This repository contains the source code for the **saga.asisaga.com** website, a key part of the ASI Saga project. The site explores the journey and philosophy behind the Genesis of Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), focusing on themes such as human consciousness, transcendence, and the future of intelligence.

## Overview

saga.asisaga.com is a static website built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and uses a custom theme from [ASISaga/theme.asisaga.com](https://github.com/ASISaga/theme.asisaga.com). The site is organized into several major sections:

- **Genesis**: The origin and vision of ASI
- **Human Essence Embedding**: How human values and consciousness are woven into superintelligent systems
- **Continuous Self-Improvement**: The ongoing evolution of ASI
- **Infinite Possibilities**: Exploring the future potential of ASI
- **Transcendent Threshold**: The merging of human and artificial intelligence
- **Human Legacy**: Celebrating the enduring impact of humanity
- **The Saga**: An interactive timeline and narrative journey

Each section is implemented as a directory with its own content and layout, leveraging Jekyll includes and data files for dynamic content such as community feeds.

Got it — let’s translate your Business Infinity – The Invitation pitch into a non‑animation, high‑impact website blueprint.  
This will be a specification document your web team can follow to build a scroll‑based, narrative‑driven site that delivers the same emotional arc as the animation — but through layout, typography, imagery, and interaction instead of motion graphics.

Business Infinity – Pitch Website Blueprint (Non‑Animation)

1. Purpose & Goals
- Present the Business Infinity pitch as an immersive, scroll‑driven story.
- Replace animation with static or lightly interactive visuals that still convey transformation.
- Keep the invitation tone — founder‑centric, emotionally resonant, and aspirational.
- Ensure the site works sound‑off and motion‑light for accessibility and performance.

2. Site Structure & Flow
The site will follow the same narrative beats as the pitch:

1. Hero / Opening Reality Check  
2. The Pain Points  
3. The Default Future  
4. The Doorway Moment  
5. The Boardroom Reveal  
6. Day One in Action  
7. Six Months Later  
8. Two Years Later  
9. Closing Invitation & Call‑to‑Action

Shabeer — if you want, I can now map this blueprint into a wireframe layout in Markdown, showing exactly how each section stacks visually, so your dev team can start building immediately without guessing. That would make this spec even more actionable.  

Do you want me to prepare that wireframe next?

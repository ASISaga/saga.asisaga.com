**Headline (H1):**
Your Vision. Your Grit. Your Relationships.

**Sub‑headline (H2):**
But right now… it runs on YOU.

## SECTION 2 — THE PAIN POINTS
[Two‑column layout: Left = text, Right = static diagram]

**Left Column:**
**H2:** Every deal. Every decision. Every approval.  
**Body:** Bottlenecked by you.

**Bullet Points:**
- Limited resources — you can’t afford the calibre of leadership you know you need.
- Decision bottlenecks — opportunities slip away while you’re still gathering context.
- Scaling strain — every new customer, market, or product threatens to break your systems.
- Tool fragmentation — your CRM, ERP, analytics, and ops tools don’t talk to each other.
- Founder dependency — the “secret sauce” lives in your head, not in a system others can run.

**Right Column:**
Static diagram: central “Founder” node with arrows from “Decisions”, “Deals”, “Approvals”.

## SECTION 3 — THE DEFAULT FUTURE
[Full‑width background split image: left = cracked, grey present; right = faded, empty office]

**Headline (H2):**
Today’s cracks → Tomorrow’s bottlenecks

**Sub‑headline:**
Opportunities lost. People burned out. Legacy at risk.

**Body Copy:**
You already know the default future if nothing changes.  
The cracks you’re patching today become tomorrow’s bottlenecks.  
Opportunities pass to faster movers. Your best people burn out.  
And when you step back — the next generation inherits a name… not a living, evolving business.

---

## SECTION 4 — THE DOORWAY MOMENT
[Full‑width image: glowing doorway in dark space]

**Headline (H2):**

**Sub‑headline:**
An invitation into a new future.

**Body Copy:**
Business Infinity is your invitation into a new future — one that starts the moment you step in.

## SECTION 5 — THE BOARDROOM REVEAL
[Two‑column layout: Left = text, Right = illustrated round table of Agents]

**Left Column:**
**H2:** 24/7. Real‑time. Self‑evolving.  
**Sub‑headline:** Mastery of legends. Steered by your vision.

**Body Copy:**
A 24/7, real‑time, self‑evolving Boardroom of Agents — each with the mastery of legends in their domain — steered by your vision, plugged into your tools, acting in perfect alignment with your priorities.

**Right Column:**
Static illustration of round table with labelled seats:
- Marketing

- Operations

## SECTION 6 — DAY ONE IN ACTION
[Four‑panel grid: each panel = one Agent in action]

**Headline (H2):**
Your network. Your instincts. Your DNA.

**Sub‑headline:**
Captured. Codified. Operational.

**Body Copy:**
Your network, your instincts, your leadership DNA — captured, codified, and made operational.  
So the business can move at the speed of opportunity, scale without breaking, and carry your vision forward — not just for the next quarter, but for the next generation.

**Panels:**
- **Marketing Agent:** Launches and optimises campaigns based on live customer signals.
- **Finance Agent:** Re‑forecasts cash flow in real time and renegotiates supplier terms.
- **Product Agent:** Re‑prioritises the roadmap after detecting competitor shifts.
- **Partnership Agent:** Nurtures and expands your network into repeatable, documented processes.

## SECTION 7 — SIX MONTHS LATER
[Two‑column layout: Left = static map with new markets highlighted, Right = text]

**Headline (H2):**
Speed of opportunity.

**Sub‑headline:**
Scaling without breaking.

**Body Copy:**
Your team moves at the speed of opportunity, not the speed of approval.  
Your network is now an operational asset.  
Scaling feels like turning a dial, not rebuilding the machine.

---

## SECTION 8 — TWO YEARS LATER

The next generation inherits not just a brand — but a system that carries your vision forward and keeps evolving it.

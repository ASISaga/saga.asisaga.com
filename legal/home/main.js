/**
 * ASI Saga Scene Overview
 *
 * This scene visualizes a stylized, animated representation of a mind or intelligence.
 * At the center is a stylized side-view outline of a brain, with distinct anatomical lobes and neuron spheres.
 * Neurons are connected by lines, and their colors/emissive intensities pulse to simulate neural activity.
 * Animated thought balloon emojis (sprites) spiral inward from the edges of the screen, orbiting and vanishing as they reach the core.
 * The entire scene is rendered with enhanced lighting and atmospheric effects for depth, creating a sense of mystery and emergence.
 * All elements are managed and animated in real time, with sophisticated visual effects and realistic neural patterns.
